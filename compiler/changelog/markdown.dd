Removed the `-transition=markdown` and `-revert=markdown` switches

This release removes the `-transition=markdown`, which prints markdown substitutions
made when processing markdown in ddoc documentation blocks, and `-revert=markdown`
switches which disables markdown substitutions in ddoc documentation blocks.

Markdown substitutions have been the default for some time now, and as of this release
is always performed.
