`TypeInfo.init` has been `@disable`d.

$(REF_OBJECT_SHORT TypeInfo.init) has been `@disable`d. Use
$(REF_OBJECT_SHORT TypeInfo.initializer) instead.

`TypeInfo.init` is a legacy alias of the method that is now called
$(REF_OBJECT_SHORT TypeInfo.initializer). The name change is necessary because
the name "init" clashes with the type property of the same name
($(GLINK2 property, init)).

The legacy alias has been deprecated since 2.072.0. It's going to be removed in
2.075.0.
